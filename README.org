*Counter-Strike: Source external cheat for GNU/Linux .*

#+TOC: headlines 2

* Description

This is my first CS:S external cheat, inspired by [[https://github.com/yoshisaac/CounterStrikeSource-Linux-Trainer][yoshisaac's repository]].

* Building

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/8dcc/cs-source-external
$ cd cs-source-external
$ make
...
#+end_src

* Usage

Since this program creates a transparent window for the overlay, you will need a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager][compositor]]. Most modern desktop environments already provide one, but if yours
doesn't (e.g. with [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]]), you will need to manually install and run it.

Here is [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg#Composite][a list]] of compositors you can try, =picom= worked fine for me.

#+begin_src console
$ picom &  # Depending on your DE/WM
$ ./cs-source-external
...
#+end_src
